Reunion receives frequent questions about the purging that can happen in an Ayahuasca ceremony. Let’s dive in together, demystify the purge and find out what to expect.

### What is a purge?

A purge is simply a release of unhelpful energetic or physical debris/toxins in our body/spirit. These may be impurities from food, byproducts of illness, accumulated emotions, unhelpful programming, or trauma.

### What are the different types of purging?

They can include vomit (top purge), bowel movements (bottom purge), emotion (crying), physical sensations (shaking, cramping), body temperature changes (sweating), or mental release ("mind running").

### Is purging a necessary part of ceremony?

Purging is an important part of an Ayahuasca journey. It is the primary “eject button” for all of the unneeded things that are holding us back. It is likely that you will experience one or more types of purging, but each ceremony is different.

### What if I am embarrassed?

You aren’t alone in this! Many people are naturally uncomfortable with releasing in the presence of others. The good news is that the room is dark, it feels rather private, and our experienced facilitators are here to help. Guests often and quickly get comfortable with purging after experiencing the profound benefits. Remember, when we purge in ceremony, it is evidence of our getting even more well!

**Takeaway:** It is normal to be concerned about purging. After a retreat, most guests come to welcome it! Better out than in!
