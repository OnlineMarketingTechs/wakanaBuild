One of the power tools we have at our side during the integration period is a greater access to our emotional landscape. One of the opportunities we have to use this power tool comes when we encounter something in our daily lives that triggers us.

A contrast event is simply something that happened that we did not prefer, that hurt, that left a mark. A trauma is essentially energy related to a contrast event that has not been cleared from our bodies. It is pain from something past that is still affecting us today.

### The Cycle of Triggers

When we get triggered, we aren’t able to healthfully respond to solely what is currently happening; we are responding to what is stored inside of us from previous similar situations. This can become a vicious and entrapping cycle.

### An Opportunity for Reconnection

These triggers, which we often do not welcome, are guides—illuminating where we have stored pain to be cleared and possibly where we have parts of ourselves that we can reconnect with. This can be a monumental opportunity for healing.

#### Steps to Work with a Trigger:

1.  **Get through the immediate situation.** Focus on your breath and repeat in your mind, “I am safe.”
2.  **Be grateful for the trigger.** See it as a faithful friend that won’t let you lose your way toward healing.
3.  **Follow the trigger.** Instead of running from it, follow the trail of breadcrumbs it has laid for you. When have you felt this way before?
4.  **Make contact.** In your mind's eye, visit the you that had this initial experience. Start with a simple hello and a compassionate, "I am sorry this happened to us."
5.  **Listen.** Spend time just being present with this part of you. Thank any parts of you that share information.
6.  **Share your intention.** State out loud your intention to release any energies related to this event that are not in service to your joy today. Ask for help.
7.  **Use a Mantra.** Utilize a mantra to reorganize these energies, such as: *"I recall to me all that is mine and I return to others lovingly all that is theirs."*

When we walk through these steps, we are maximizing the opportunity a trigger brings for our healing.
